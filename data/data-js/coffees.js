    description: "One of the rarest and most luxurious coffees in the world, known for its smooth, rich flavor and low acidity.",
    longDescription:
      `Kopi Luwak, often called 'Civet Coffee', is made using beans that have been eaten and digested by the Asian palm civet. The beans undergo fermentation in the civet’s digestive system before being collected, cleaned, and roasted. This process gives the coffee a unique, ultra-smooth flavor profile with rich, earthy undertones and a hint of chocolate. Despite controversy around ethical sourcing, properly sourced Kopi Luwak remains a prized delicacy among coffee connoisseurs.
      
      Kopi Luwak is one of the most exclusive and unusual coffees in the world, originating in Indonesia. What makes this coffee truly unique is the process it undergoes: the beans are first eaten by the Asian palm civet, a small nocturnal mammal native to Southeast Asia. The civet selects only the ripest coffee cherries, and as they pass through its digestive system, natural fermentation occurs. Enzymes in the civet’s stomach break down the proteins that typically give coffee its bitter flavor, resulting in beans that produce an exceptionally smooth, mellow cup with low acidity and deep earthy notes.
      
      After the beans are excreted, they are carefully collected, cleaned, and roasted to perfection. Ethically sourced Kopi Luwak, which ensures the animals are wild or well cared for, is a rare delicacy prized by adventurous coffee lovers worldwide. The result is a luxurious and complex coffee experience that tells a story unlike any other.
